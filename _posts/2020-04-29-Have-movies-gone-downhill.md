## Have Movies Gone Downhill In Recent Years

As a movie lover, it's been a Question of some concern to me. It seems to me that while special effects and technology have advanced, movies have gotten worse. The Question, have movies gotten worse? Why? Are larger movie companies simply not making the cut anymore?


Using a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies/data">Dataset</a> pulled from Kaggle, I took a deeper look at the Question. Ironically, the creator of said dataset made it for simallar reasons. I started by importing the dataset and taking a good look at what was contained, specifically at what I would need in order to find my Answer.

After sifting through the data it became apparent that it was pretty useable with only a few tweaks. To start I had to fix a rather simple problem that would affect my data at a later time. Inside the dataset there were two duplicate companies but with different names, Columbia Pictures Corporation and Columbia Pictures. After that I needed to slim down the dataset to have only what I needed to find my Answer.






After some data manipulation I was able to find something rather interesting. Over a span of thirty years (1986-2016) there was about a .5 rise in the average rating of movies.
