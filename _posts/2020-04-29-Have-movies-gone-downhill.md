## Have Movies Gone Downhill In Recent Years

As a movie lover, it's been a Question of some concern to me. It seems to me that while special effects and technology have advanced, movies have gotten worse. The Question, have movies gotten worse? Why? Are larger movie companies simply not making the cut anymore?


Using a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies/data">Dataset</a> pulled from Kaggle, I took a deeper look at the Question. Ironically, the creator of said dataset made it for simallar reasons. After some data manipulation I was able to find something rather interesting. Over a span of thirty years (1986-2016) there was about a .5 rise in the average rating of movies.
