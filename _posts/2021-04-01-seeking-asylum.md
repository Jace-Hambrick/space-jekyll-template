<h1>Who and What?</h1>
</br>
</br>
This past month I have been working with the Human Rights First, a 501(c)3 organization to develop an application that uses optical character recognition to scan input court decisions for important values and inserts them into a database. The application is to assist immigration attorneys and refugee representatives in advocating for clients in asylum cases by identifying patterns in judicial decisions, and by predicting possible outcomes.
</br>
</br>
Going into this project I was afraid that I wouldn’t be of much use to the team and the company. I wasn’t very confident in my abilities, and felt woefully unprepared for what I faced. I could only hope that I would be able to rise to the occasion and create something wonderful.

<h1>Contributing to the Cause</h1>

Two weeks into the project, over my fears and smashing through hurdles, I had made significant progress on my addition to the cause.
 Due to the nature of the project the first thing I had done was take an in-depth look at data ethics, something I, and the rest of the team, was rather unfamiliar with. I devoted almost a full day towards this, as this would have a big impact on the stakeholders. Afterwards I researched my topic, looking at various other sites that visualized court data.
 </br>
 </br>
This is where I came face to face with one of the biggest challenges. Anything I made now would look drastically different and possibly unusable in the future as more data was added to the project. I needed to come up with something that would allow me to have a usable visualization both now, and in the future.
</br>
</br>
My solution was to make a visual that had a baseline that wouldn’t change, and the baseline that I chose was the world. Countries are immovable objects that have stayed the same for centuries now, and by using the world as a baseline, the visual itself will maintain its ease of use, requiring very little maintenance.
Having ensured the data was ethical, I then transformed the given data into something more useful and created two world maps. One, a choropleth map, took a look at all the countries that had asylum seekers and displayed their protected grounds.
