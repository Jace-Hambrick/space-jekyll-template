<b>Who and What?</b>
</br>
This past month I have been working with the Human Rights First, a 501(c)3 organization to develop an application that uses optical character recognition to scan input court decisions for important values and inserts them into a database. The application is to assist immigration attorneys and refugee representatives in advocating for clients in asylum cases by identifying patterns in judicial decisions, and by predicting possible outcomes.

Going into this project I was afraid that I wouldn’t be of much use to the team and the company. I wasn’t very confident in my abilities, and felt woefully unprepared for what I faced. I could only hope that I would be able to rise to the occasion and create something wonderful.
