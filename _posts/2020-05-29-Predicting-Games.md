<b>I am a gamer, as are most of us.</b> So for my project I decided to try and see if I could accurately predict how many people owned a specific game.


Using a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/tamber/steam-video-games">Dataset</a> pulled from Kaggle, I explored the data and slowly figured out what it was I would be looking for. But first the data needed to be cleaned. The main issues being (1) the column for Owners being a string instead of integer, (2) the NaNs floating throughout the data, (3) a number of columns that had been set with a delimiter which blurred the data, and (4) columns with to much Cardinality and No Variation.

The next step was to clean the data by removing the columns with high cardinality and the 'name' column, which had a specific value for each row. Taking apart the columns with multiple tags in each was an issue of sperating the tags by the given delimiter (;) and turning them into features by assigning them to (1) if the feature was contained and (0) if it was not.

Once this was all done I made a visualization based on games that had more than 50,000 positive ratings so that I could get a better idea of what I was working with.

I wanted to see if I could accurately predict how many owners each game had. The following graph shows what the mean (blue) and median (red) are for the dataset, with mean being 184,360. And after calculating the MAE (mean absolute error) I learned that if we just guessed every game had 184,361 owners, we would be off by 266,700 on average. Keep in mind that far to the right there are a few games with around 10,000,000 owners.

The result is rather conclusive. The top 3 movie companies have gotten more consistent, but are still stuck at just about 6. So let's look at our question.

<b>Have Movies Gotten Worse In Recent Years?</b>


Well we can now say that no, they have not gotten worse, at least not for the top movie studios. But that doesn't really answer my question. So the next thing to look at is every company, and to do so I look back at the Graph_Data dataset. Everything I need is here but I not exclusive from the rest of the data. To fix this I need to make another funtion, this time to find out the average ratings of every movie provided, by the year it was released.

Taking a crosstab, or comparing two seperate columns of the dataset against eachother, of the Scores and Years. Using this new dataset I was able to look at the average ratings of every year. And the result was rather interesting. Over a span of thirty years (1986-2016) there was about a .5 rise in the average rating of movies as seen in the two charts below.

Well that answers the Question. But <b>who</b> is making the better movies, and what movies <i>are</i> the better movies. Another question for us to answer, and a rather simple one at that. With a quick bit of exploring I was able to put together a new chart for your enjoyment.
